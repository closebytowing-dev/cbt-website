## 🚨 CRITICAL ISSUES FOUND

### 1. **PRICING DATA DUPLICATION & CONFLICTS**

You have **THREE different places** storing pricing information:

#### A. `prices/` collection (Used by website)
```
prices/rates → travelRate: $3/mi
prices/services → Battery Jump Start: $88
prices/towing → Local Towing: $75 hookup + $8/mi
```

#### B. `services/` collection (Used by dispatcher app?)
```
services/jump-start → baseFee: $75
services/local-towing → baseFee: $75, perMile: $8
services/travel-miles → ratePerMile: $1.75  ⚠️ DIFFERENT FROM prices!
```

#### C. `settings/pricing` document (Old/legacy?)
```
settings/pricing/travelMiles → ratePerMile: $1.75  ⚠️ DIFFERENT FROM prices!
settings/pricing/timeMultipliers → Has after-hours multipliers!
```

**🔴 MAJOR CONFLICT:**
- `prices/rates` says travelRate = $3/mi
- `services/travel-miles` says ratePerMile = $1.75/mi
- `settings/pricing/travelMiles` says ratePerMile = $1.75/mi

**Which is correct?** This causes inconsistent pricing between website and dispatcher app!

---

### 2. **AFTER-HOURS PRICING ALREADY EXISTS!**

Found in `settings/pricing/timeMultipliers`:
```json
{
  "standard": { "multiplier": 1, "start": "07:00", "end": "17:00" },
  "evening": { "multiplier": 1.4, "start": "17:00", "end": "20:00" },
  "overnight": { "multiplier": 2, "start": "20:00", "end": "07:00" }
}
```

**BUT** these multipliers are NOT being used by the website (only in Firebase, not in code).

---

### 3. **DATA STRUCTURE INCONSISTENCIES**

#### Services Collection Issues:
- `displayOrder` document contains service data (should just be a number)
- Inconsistent field names: `calcType` vs calculation type
- Mixed migration metadata (`migratedAt`, `migratedFrom`)
- `afterHoursEligible` exists but not used

#### Jobs Collection Issues:
- Inconsistent field usage across jobs
- Some jobs from "website" source, others from "dispatcher"
- Mixed status values
- No clear job lifecycle tracking

## 🎯 MIGRATION STEPS

### Phase 1: Fix Pricing Conflicts (CRITICAL)
1. ✅ Decide: Travel rate = $1.75 or $3?
2. ✅ Decide: Local towing hookup = $65 or $75?
3. Create `config/pricing` with correct values
4. Update website code to use `config/pricing`
5. Update dispatcher app to use `config/pricing`
6. Archive old `prices/`, `services/`, `settings/pricing`

### Phase 2: Add After-Hours Pricing
1. Create `config/time_multipliers`
2. Update pricing logic to apply multipliers
3. Add UI indicator for after-hours rates
4. Test all time periods

### Phase 3: Clean Up Jobs
1. Rename `live_jobs` → `jobs`
2. Archive completed jobs to `archived_jobs`
3. Standardize job schema
4. Add proper indexing

### Phase 4: Remove Legacy Data
1. Delete `settings/pricing` (moved to config)
2. Delete `services/` collection (moved to config/pricing)
3. Delete old `prices/` collection (moved to config/pricing)
4. Clean up migration metadata

## ❓ QUESTIONS TO ANSWER BEFORE PROCEEDING

1. **Travel Rate:** Is it $1.75/mile or $3/mile?
2. **Local Towing Hookup:** Is it $65 or $75?
3. **Dispatcher App:** Do you have a separate dispatcher app using the `services` collection?
4. **After-Hours:** Do you want to use the existing multipliers (1.4x evening, 2x overnight) or your new ones (1.2x, 1.3x, 1.5x)?
5. **Service Prices:** Should all roadside services be $88 base (before discount) or $75?
6. **Archive Strategy:** Should completed jobs older than X days be moved to `archived_jobs`?

---

## 🚀 RECOMMENDED IMMEDIATE ACTIONS

1. **STOP** - Don't add any more pricing until conflicts are resolved
2. **AUDIT** - Check which pricing source your dispatcher app uses
3. **DECIDE** - Choose correct values for conflicting prices
4. **UNIFY** - Create single `config/pricing` collection
5. **MIGRATE** - Move all apps to use `config/pricing`
6. **ADD** - Implement after-hours multipliers
7. **TEST** - Verify all pricing calculations are correct
8. **CLEANUP** - Remove duplicate/legacy collections

---

## 📝 NOTES

- Your `settings/pricing` already has after-hours multipliers that you're not using!
- You have both $1.75 and $3 travel rates in different places
- The `services` collection seems to be from a dispatcher app migration
- Jobs from "website" source have different schema than "dispatcher" jobs
- Invoice numbering is centralized in `settings/invoiceCounter` ✅ Good!
